                                        👋 Hi there, I'm [Ayush Kumar]!

## 🚀 About Me
    I am a passionate web developer who is proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently expanding my skillset by learning back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. By the end of this week, I hope to have completed my back-end learning and move on to learning React ⚛️.

    In addition to my web development skills, I'm also proficient in Java ☕️ and have a 5-star rating on HackerRank 🌟.

    I'm excited to continue learning and growing my skills as a developer, and I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out and connect with me! 🤝
